            Drones, commonly known for their use in military conflict, are now being
            recognized for their many potential commercial uses. The Drone industry, military and non-military, has an estimated value of 90 billion over the next decade. 
            <br> <br>
            Drones can be used widely in the area of farming, such as watering and fertilizing crops. Drones are also able to enter extreme weather without risk, possibly allowing for more accurate storm tracking and research. The Drones observational abilities can be used to protect and track endangered species, and be used to sight wildfires faster than human helicopters. Drones would also be used for search and rescue missions, being able to traverse vast stretches of land and get into smaller, hard to reach areas.
            <br> <br>
           With all the possible safety elements and industrial uses of drones,private commercial groups will be able to come up with their own creative ideas for the use of drones.
        The possibilities are near endless, confined only to human imagination.
        <br>
        <br>
        Research for Drones has been conducted in many Plain states, areas large flat and clear of obstacles. Also, the FAA(Federal Air Association) set up six research sites for drones, one being North Dakota, to give Drone research diverse environments. <br> <br>
      
      The FAA has put the advancement of the commercial Drone industry on hold, until such time they can produce regulations to allow public access to commercial drone use while still maintaining privacy and clear airspace for larger aircraft. 
      
      <br><br>rent Drone use is limited to recreational activities, while maintaining safe distance from airports, and commercial use is strictly limited to those with special authorization.
      <br><br>
      Many are excited for the full access to Drone use, it will just be a matter of assuring the public about their maintained privacy, and that Drones are not strictly military.
